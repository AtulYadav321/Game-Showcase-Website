      <h3>Create a VIRTUAL woRld</h3>
      <p>If you are reading this article, it is because you are different and you want to be different from everyone else. In order to work hard, you need a clear vision of what you want and where you are going. You have to focus on yourself, and try to convince yourself instead of people who do not believe in you. It feels kind of lonely when you work in silence but remember, you eat better.The first thing about where fitness starts is food. We should take nutritious food. Food rich in protein, vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates is very essential. Protein is necessary for body growth. Carbohydrates provide the required energy in performing various tasks. Vitamin and minerals help in building bones and boosting our immune system.</p>

        <h4>E-sport experience </h4> 
        <P> It is a session between two opponents who have trained or cross trained in any genre of gaming. Although it is mainstream event for gaming, there is no reason why it should be banned in any state here in the United States. Like most, there are rules that one most abide by , the fights are sanctioned, so rules must apply.</P>

        <P>Many reasons to go to gym. Of course exercise is priority. The gym has plenty exercise machines that people can use to develop different muscle groups. Kulas (para. 1) in her article, “The Advantages of Going to the Gym Every Day”, says at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise should be done by adults five days in a week so going to the gym everyday will meet that goal. </P>

        <P>Weight Lifting is very good for humans in many different ways.  It is a great way to get exercise, and a great way to meet new people.  There are many positives, and some negatives, it is easy, enjoyable and makes humans more social, you can do it at anytime, and it relieves stress rather than give stress.  Although there are some negatives with running, there are also many positives.</P>
